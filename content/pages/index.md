overview: |
  Statamic is different than other Content Management Systems like WordPress, Drupal, or Craft CMS in many important and powerful ways, but the most obvious is **we removed the MySQL database.** It's for the greater good.

By eliminating the rigid, relational database, we unlock the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine, and provide you with a Control Panel that is flexible in ways you may assume are impossible.

Out of the box, Statamic runs on a "flat file" engine based on Markdown and YAML files with an optional Redis driver for when high-performance and concurrency is important. Read on to explore all the ways Statamic can change the way you build sites forever.
