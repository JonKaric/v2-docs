overview: |
  Statamic cuts out the database to create a faster, more productive way to build, manage, and version control beautifully creative, bespoke websites.
---
By eliminating the rigid, relational database, we unlock the ability to create and support any data structures you can imagine, and provide you with a Control Panel that is flexible in ways you may assume are impossible. Statamic can scale to heights not possible with a MySQL database.

Out of the box, Statamic runs on a flat file engine based on Markdown and YAML files and a smart caching system. As your site grows, you can take advantage of other storage mechanisms to scale up to sites as large as [spiegel.de](https://spiegel.de).
